# GithubActionCertPrep
This repo is to help anyone with an introduction to GitHub Actions with preparation for the certification in mind.
/templates/ contains several examples of different concepts in GitHub Actions. You can run any of these yourself and watch the workflow run on the Actions tab. Simply move the workflow file from /templates/ to  .github/workflows locally for it to be ran on the workflow.

I also included an incredibly useful 3rd party repo link below for Act - localized Actions testing without haveto wait for GitHub to process anything. I highly reccomend installing this before beginning down these paths, it will speed things up quite a bit.
